description: Solution for OverTheWire Bandit level 17 challenge.
---

## Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to `a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000`. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Walkthrough

Solution for the OverTheWire.org [Bandit level 16 -> 17](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit17.html)

Login to the server using the password obtained from the previous level [Bandit level 15 -> 16](/posts/overthewire-bandit-16).  

username: `bandit16`  

```bash
ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

This level has multiple steps to find the password.  

1. Find what ports are open between 31000 and 32000
2. Find which ports are using SSL encryption
3. Get next password by sending current password to the correct port.

We use a network mapper to check each port for their open/closed status and what service is running on the ports.  
The network mapper we will use is [nmap](https://nmap.org/) and it was developed by the same people as the ncat tool used in the previous level.

Nmap can check what service is running on ports as well as whether they are open or closed.

The nmap command to find open ports between 31000 and 32000 and what service is running is

`nmap -sV -p 31000-32000 localhost`  

* `-sV`   Version detection
* `-p 31000-320000`   only check ports 31000 - 320000
* `localhost`    the target for the network mapping scan

Running the command will give us this output.

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV -p 31000-32000 localhost

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 89.60 seconds
bandit16@bandit:~$
```

The scan shows us that there is 5 ports open and that only 2 of them are using SSL.

31046/tcp open  echo  
`31518/tcp open  ssl/echo`  
31691/tcp open  echo  
`31790/tcp open  ssl/unknown`  
31960/tcp open  echo  

Port 31518 will repeat anything we send it back to us.  
The port we need is port 31790.  

Like the previous levels we use ncat to open a SSL encrypted connection to port 31790 on localhost and send the password for the current level.

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ ncat --ssl localhost 31790

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Instead of a password we get a large amount of base64 encoded data.  
This data is a RSA Private Key.

By copy and pasting the base64 data and the surrounding '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----' and '-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----' into a new file we can create a usuable ssh private key like we used in [level 13 -> 14]({% post_url 2021-11-13-overthewire-bandit-14 %})

It doesn't matter what name you give the file. I named it ssh_key.  
Before we can use the ssh_key to login to the next level we need to change it's permissions so that only we(the user) can read and write.

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ chmod 600 ssh_key

bandit16@bandit:~$ ssh -i ssh_key bandit17@localhost

bandit17@bandit:~$
```

Now that we are logged into bandit17 we have completed the level but we should retrieve the password to make it easier to log into bandit17 in future.

All passwords are located in /etc/bandit_pass/ but you can only read the file with same name as the level you are logged into.

```bash
bandit17@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
